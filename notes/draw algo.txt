1: build tree of draw requests
	send draw requests
	clear frame buffer
	set timeout (e.g. 10 ms)

2: incomming draw response
	status:
		0 -> ok, continue
		1 -> failed, draw placeholder instead
		2 -> failed, draw nothing at all
	in order?
		draw
		check for scheduled responses blocked by this one and draw them if possible
	else
		schedule for drawing

3: all draw responses arrived within timeout
	flip back buffer
	free shared memory buffers of draw responses

4: timeout fires and some responses are still missing
	draw all scheduled responses, replace missing layers with placeholder tile
	mark all shared memory buffers as retained
		keep them available for later redrawing
		set a timestamp for them so we know how old they are (to throw them away when we no longer need them)

5: late draw response arrives
	use retained shared memory buffers to fill tile table and draw entire screen
	free all shared memory buffers

6: user interaction with late draw responses still missing
	issue new draw call (send out new draw requests, ect.)
	if timeout is missed again:
		use retained shared memory buffer from prev request to reconstruct as much of the missing buffer as possible. fill the rest with placeholder tiles
